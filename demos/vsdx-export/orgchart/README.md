# Organization Chart Demo - VSDX Export for yFiles for HTML

<img src="../../../doc/demo-thumbnails/vsdx-organization-chart.webp" alt="demo-thumbnail" height="320"/>

This demo shows how to create an interactive organization chart from JSON data and export it to a VSDX file.

The source data is easily converted to a yFiles graph using class [TreeBuilder](https://docs.yworks.com/vsdx-html/api/TreeBuilder).

The visualization of the employee is defined by an svg-template which is interpreted by the node style using the [Vue 2 framework](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html).

The demo also shows how a [FilteredGraphWrapper](https://docs.yworks.com/vsdx-html/api/FilteredGraphWrapper) can be used to display a subgraph of the model graph.

## Automatic Layout

The organization chart is arranged automatically with the [TreeLayout](https://docs.yworks.com/vsdx-html/api/TreeLayout) and the [CompactSubtreePlacer](https://docs.yworks.com/vsdx-html/api/CompactSubtreePlacer) which determines the best arrangement strategy for each node in order to achieve a compact and clear layout.

## Organization Chart View

Mouse Wheel

Changes the zoom level of the view.

Click on Employee

Selects the employee in the chart and shows the corresponding data in the properties view.

## Properties View

Click on a superior, subordinate, or colleague link to select and zoom to the corresponding node in the organization chart.

## Things to Try

- Click the **Export to VSDX** button to export the organization chart to a VSDX file.
- Click on the port in the bottom center of a node to hide and show the children. **Hide children** by clicking on ![hide children](resources/minus.svg). **Show children** by clicking on ![show children](resources/plus.svg).
- Right-click on the node to open the **context menu**. For the selected node, you have the following options:
  - Hide parent: hides the parent of the currently selected employee.
  - Show parent: shows the parent of the currently selected employee.
  - Hide children: hides the children of the currently selected employee.
  - Show children: Shows the children of the currently selected employee.
  - Show all: show all employees
- In the toolbar, you can expand_all **Show All** nodes.
- Change the zoom level to switch between three different levels of detail for node visualization.

## Developer Information

- To load your own data into the demo, replace the data in the `./model/orgchart-data.ts` file. If your data is structured differently, change the `buildGraph()` function in the `./model/data-loading.ts` file and/or the `Employee` type.
- To disable interactivity, remove the `initializeInteractivity()` call in `./input.ts.`
- To use the collapsing feature in your own application, copy the `./CollapsibleTree.ts` file and, for interactivity, the `./input.ts` and `./ui/orgchart-context-menu.ts` files.
- To use the search feature in your own application, copy the `./OrgChartGraphSearch.ts` and `../utils/GraphSearch.ts` files.
